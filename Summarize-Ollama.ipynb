      "| **Development** | Large community, wide adoption | Smaller community, but growing rapidly |\n",
      "| **Speed** | Relatively slow compared to PyTorch | Faster development and prototyping capabilities |\n",
      "| **Ease of use** | Steeper learning curve due to complex architecture | Easier to learn and use, especially for beginners |\n",
